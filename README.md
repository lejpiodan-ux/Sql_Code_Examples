# Welcome to my SQL scripts section!
##### This is the place where I am tracking my sql progress.

### I have 2 folders with some queries written by me.
##### Every folder contains Code/Result/png of written script

### Folders are sorted chronologically from 01-(...) 
##### The higher number of folders -> The more experienced I was when writing this query.

## Info

Some of the latest folders contain combined different SQL techniques, for example folder dedicated
to Window Function may include some CTEs or Subqueries. I didn't create another folder for this, like the Common Table Expressions folder, 
because there is no need to have more folders.
