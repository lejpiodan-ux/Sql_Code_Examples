# Welcome to my SQL- scripts section!
##### This is the place where I am tracking my sql progress.

### I have 2 folders with some queries written by me.
##### Every folder contains Code/Result/png of written script

### Folders are sorted chronogically from 01-(...) 
##### The higher number of folder -> The more experienced i was when writing this querry.

## Info

Some latest folders contains combined different sql techniques, for example folder dedicated
to Window Function may include some Cte's or Subquery. I didnt create another folder for this, like: Common Table Expressions folder
because there is no need to have more folders.
